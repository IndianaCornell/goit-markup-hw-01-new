### 🧱 Markup

- **«B1»** The Portfolio page layout is in the `portfolio.html` file.
- **«B2»** HTML markup is done for all layout elements.
- **«B3»** Tags are used according to their semantics.
- **«B4»** HTML passes the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) without errors.
- **«B5»** Class names are descriptive and understandable for other developers.
- **«B6»** Class names do not contain capital letters, spaces, transliteration or tag names. Only English letters and hyphen-separated words.
- **«B7»** The `href` attributes of the `Studio` and `Portfolio` navigation links contain relative paths. Clicking them opens the corresponding page in the same browser tab.
- **«B8»** All `<img>` tags have size attributes (at least `width`).
- **«B9»** Images are exported from the layout in **JPG** format.
- **«B10»** Groups of similar elements are enclosed in `<ul>` lists.
- **«B11»** The filter on the Portfolio page is a list of `<button>` elements with `type="button"` set.
- **«B12»** The `header` and `footer` markup is identical across all pages.
- **«B13»** All fonts (Raleway 800; Roboto 400, 500, 700, 900) are connected via a single [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) link.
- **«B14»** No additional elements like `<span>` or `<a>` are used inside button markup.

### 🎨 Styling

- **«C1»** No global styles applied to elements except `<body>`.
- **«C2»** Class selectors are used for styling.
- **«C3»** Styles do not contain `!important`.
- **«C4»** Interactive elements (buttons, links) have active states on `hover` or keyboard `focus`, as defined in the layout.
- **«C5»** Contact text in `header` and `footer` changes color on hover or focus.
- **«C6»** CSS variables store color palette values (text, background, accent).
- **«C7»** `<body>` uses `font-family` with Roboto as default.
- **«C8»** Font fallback (`sans-serif`) is specified in `font-family` at the end.
- **«C9»** Roboto is explicitly set only on `<body>`; other elements inherit it.
- **«C10»** Default `color` is set on `<body>` and inherited or overridden in children.
- **«C11»** `font-size` of all text matches layout values exactly.
- **«C12»** `line-height` of all text matches layout values exactly and uses a multiplier (not `px`).
- **«C13»** `color` of all text elements matches layout values.
- **«C14»** `font-weight` of all text matches layout values.
- **«C15»** `font-weight` is explicitly set only if it differs from the browser default.
- **«C16»** All buttons use `cursor: pointer`.
- **«C17»** Default browser styles are not redundantly overridden (e.g., no `cursor: pointer` on links, no `font-weight: 400` on paragraphs).
